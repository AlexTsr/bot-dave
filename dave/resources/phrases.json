I'll try to figure out which one you mean, but it helps if you tell me *for* which one you want. e.g. ```table status``` or ```table status for south```\n\n",
    "admin_info": "The bot will check Meetup every 15' for new events and RSVPs. If there's a new event it will create a board on Trello with the same name as the event's title. If there are new RSVPs it will announce it on Slack and add them to the respective Trello board (they will have the meetup user ID as a description, do not change this since it's used by the bot to identify users). If someone cancels their RSVP it will add a 'cancelled' label on Trello.\n\nEach Trello board will have one column per table. Each table column should have an 'Info' card, which should contain the blurb for the game in its description. The GM's card should have the 'gm' label. All these are used by the bot on the *table status* output.\n\nOn each check the bot will also add new users to the 'Address Book' board with the meetup ID, a placeholder for their Slack username and a 'NoSlack' label. This needs some manual work to add the Slack username and remove the label. This will be used in the future for allowing interaction with meetup from Slack"
    "south_info": "Here's the info for the next South session:\n\n*Address*: Folkparksvägen 172. The door should be propped open, if it's not, ping this channel.\n*Transport*: Pendeltåg: Älvsjö. Bus 142: Solberga Park.\n*Bring with you*: 20kr _in cash_ to cover room rental.\nSnacks, dice, notepaper optional but recommended.\n*Special requests*: we have some members who have a strong reaction to perfumes, colognes, and other fragrances so if you do wear those please keep them discreet.\n*Accessibility information*: Ground floor, step free accessible. The venue is a single large open space. The combined chat from the tables can get quite noisy.\n*Code of Conduct*: Adherence to the Code of Conduct is a condition of entry so ensure you've read and understood it. We pride ourselves on being a friendly, welcoming, and inclusive environment and that it's everyone's responsibility to enable that."
